## Project Name
Smart Parking System (SPS)

## Short Description
The Smart Parking System (SPS) is designed to provide an innovative solution to parking challenges in urban areas. The project leverages license plate recognition technology and data-driven management systems to optimize parking operations, benefiting both drivers and municipal authorities.

## What is the Problem?
Globally, increasing vehicle traffic, inadequate parking spaces, and inefficient parking management cause significant issues, particularly in urban centers.

- Over 70% of urban parking facilities are constantly at full capacity.
- Drivers waste time searching for parking spots, contributing to increased carbon emissions.
- Existing parking areas rely on manual systems, making real-time data access challenging and costly.

## How Can Technology Help?
Integrating artificial intelligence and image processing technologies can revolutionize parking management by:

- **License Plate Recognition**: Automatically recognizing vehicle plates to streamline entry and exit processes.
- **Live Data Monitoring**: Providing real-time information on parking availability, helping drivers locate vacant spots efficiently.
- **Data Analytics**: Generating long-term reports on parking usage to aid strategic decision-making.

## The Idea
The project utilizes YOLO and EasyOCR-based license plate recognition algorithms to:

- Detect and register vehicle entries and exits.
- Identify vacant parking spots and direct drivers accordingly.
- Sync data with the municipal parking management system for reporting and strategic planning.

## The Architecture
The system comprises the following core modules:

1. **Image Processing Module**: Vehicle detection using YOLO and license plate recognition with EasyOCR.
2. **API Layer**: Data processing and storage implemented with Flask.
3. **User Interface**: A desktop application built with Tkinter for user interaction.

## Detailed Description
The Smart Parking System leverages state-of-the-art technologies like YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time vehicle detection and EasyOCR for license plate recognition. The system aims to improve parking management by providing real-time data on available parking spots, automated vehicle entry and exit, and integration with existing municipal systems for effective traffic management.
